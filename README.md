# Zeus21: Lightning-fast simulations of cosmic dawn

Zeus21 encodes the effective model for the 21-cm power spectrum, global signal from [Muñoz 2023a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08506). The goal is to capture all the nonlocal and nonlinear physics of cosmic dawn in a light and fully Pythonic code. Zeus21 takes advantage of the approximate log-normality of the star-formation rate density (SFRD) during cosmic dawn to compute the 21-cm power spectrum analytically. It agrees with more expensive semi-numerical simulations to roughly 10% precision, but has comparably negligible computational cost (~ s) and memory requirements. Now Zeus21 can also predict galaxy UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) and their linear clustering (galaxy bias) at any z, 

 Zeus21 can also predict galaxy UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) and their linear clustering (galaxy bias) at any z, see [Muñoz et al. 2023b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09403) for the implementation and application to JWST. Now Zeus21 includes Population III stars with inhomogeneous Lyman-Werner feedback and relative velocities (with their fluctuations), as described in [Cruz et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18294).

Zeus21 (Zippy Early-Universe Solver for 21-cm) pairs well with data from [HERA](https://reionization.org/), but can be used for any 21-cm inference or prediction. Current capabilities include finding the 21-cm power spectrum (at a broad range of k and z), the global signal, IGM temperatures (Tk, Ts, Tcolor), neutral fraction xHI, Lyman-alpha fluxes, and the evolution of the SFRD; all across cosmic dawn z=5-35. Zeus21 can use three different astrophysical models, one of which emulates 21cmFAST, and can vary the cosmology through CLASS. 

If you want to get started I recommend checking the Jupyter tutorial in `docs/`. Full documentation in [ReadTheDocs](https://zeus21.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), more coming soon. Here is an example power spectrum (at k=0.3/Mpc) and global signal as a function of redshift, for two cases of X-ray luminosity. You can run it yourself with the tutorial included!

## Installation

You can download and install this package by doing:

```
git clone https://github.com/julianbmunoz/zeus21.git zeus21
cd zeus21/
pip install .
```

that should take care of all dependencies (remember to work in your favorite conda env). If you have issues with cache'd versions of packages you can add `--no-cache-dir` at the end of `pip install .`. 

**NOTE:** You may run into problems when pip-installing `classy` (the Python wrapper of `CLASS`). If so, their installation guide is [here](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public/wiki/Installation), but in short the steps are:

```
git clone https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public.git class
cd class/
make
cd python/
python setup.py install --user
```

(modifying the Makefile to your `gcc` as needed)
